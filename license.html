      <p><strong>IMPORTANT NOTICE:</strong> Please read this agreement carefully before downloading, installing, or using BrowserBox. By accessing or using the software, you agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. If you do not agree, do not use the software. If you are entering into this agreement on behalf of an entity, you represent that you have the authority to bind that entity to these terms.</p>

      <h2>1. Definitions</h2>
      <p><strong>1.1 "DOSAYGO"</strong> means DOSAYGO Corporation, a company incorporated in Oregon, United States of America, the owner and licensor of BrowserBox.</p>
      <p><strong>1.2 "BrowserBox"</strong> means the proprietary software provided by DOSAYGO, including its embeddable, multi-user, server-based browser for remote isolation, zero-trust security, co-browsing, and related features, along with any updates, documentation, and associated materials.</p>
      <p><strong>1.3 "You" or "Licensee"</strong> means the individual or entity entering into this Agreement with DOSAYGO.</p>
      <p><strong>1.4 "License Key"</strong> means the unique code issued by DOSAYGO to activate and enable use of BrowserBox under a valid Subscription.</p>
      <p><strong>1.5 "Subscription"</strong> means the paid plan purchased by Licensee that grants access to a License Key and the right to use BrowserBox under this Agreement.</p>

      <h2>2. License Grant</h2>
      <p><strong>2.1 Grant of License.</strong> Subject to payment of applicable fees and compliance with this Agreement, DOSAYGO grants Licensee a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, revocable license to use BrowserBox in accordance with the terms of the Subscription and the associated License Key.</p>
      <p><strong>2.2 License Key Requirement.</strong> Use of BrowserBox requires a valid License Key. Without a valid License Key, BrowserBox will display a warning ("Your copy of BrowserBox is unlicensed") and terminate after two (2) minutes.</p>
      <p><strong>2.3 Restrictions.</strong> Licensee shall not:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Share, sell, lease, sublicense, or otherwise distribute BrowserBox to third parties;</li>
        <li>Reverse engineer, decompile, disassemble, or otherwise attempt to derive the source code of BrowserBox, except as permitted by applicable law or open-source licenses;</li>
        <li>Remove, alter, or obscure any proprietary notices, branding, or trademarks in BrowserBox;</li>
        <li>Circumvent or attempt to bypass the License Key authentication or enforcement mechanisms.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>3. Fees and Payment</h2>
      <p><strong>3.1 Subscription Fees.</strong> Licensee shall purchase a Subscription through <a href="https://dosaygo.com/pricing">https://dosaygo.com/pricing</a> or an authorized reseller. Subscription fees, billing terms, and renewal policies are specified at the point of purchase.</p>
      <p><strong>3.2 Subscription Term.</strong> Subscriptions automatically renew unless terminated by Licensee in accordance with the Subscription terms. Failure to pay fees will, after a reasonable grace period, result in deactivation of the License Key and termination of access to BrowserBox.</p>
      <p><strong>3.3 No Free Use.</strong> Any use of BrowserBox, including for commercial, personal, development, or testing purposes, requires a paid Subscription.</p>

      <h2>4. Use of BrowserBox</h2>
      <p><strong>4.1 Responsibility.</strong> Licensee is responsible for all instances of BrowserBox it deploys. Use by Licensee's customers requires separate licenses for those customers.</p>
      <p><strong>4.2 Open-Source Components.</strong> BrowserBox may include open-source components subject to their own licenses. In case of conflict, those licenses govern the use of those components only.</p>
      <p><strong>4.3 Usage Monitoring.</strong> BrowserBox may transmit usage data to DOSAYGO for compliance verification and product improvement, as detailed in DOSAYGO's Privacy Policy and Terms of Service.</p>

      <h2>5. Ownership</h2>

      <p><strong>5.2 Source Code Access.</strong> If Licensee accesses BrowserBox source code, modifications are permitted for internal use only, but ownership remains with DOSAYGO.</p>
      <p><strong>5.3 Enforcement.</strong> Any attempt to tamper with the License Key system will result in immediate termination of this license.</p>

      <h2>6. Termination</h2>
      <p><strong>6.1 Termination by DOSAYGO.</strong> DOSAYGO may terminate this Agreement with notice for material breach by Licensee or immediately for unlicensed use.</p>
      <p><strong>6.2 Effect of Termination.</strong> Upon termination, Licensee must:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Cease all use of BrowserBox;</li>
        <li>Delete all copies of BrowserBox and License Keys in its possession;</li>
        <li>Acknowledge that DOSAYGO may remotely disable access.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>6.3 Survival.</strong> Sections addressing ownership, liability, indemnification, and governing law shall survive termination.</p>

      <h2>7. Disclaimer and Limitation of Liability</h2>
      <p><strong>7.1 No Warranties.</strong> BrowserBox is provided "AS IS" without warranties of any kind, whether express, implied, or statutory, including warranties of merchantability or fitness for a particular purpose.</p>
      <p><strong>7.2 Limitation of Liability.</strong> DOSAYGO's aggregate liability under this Agreement shall not exceed fifty U.S. dollars ($50). DOSAYGO shall not be liable for indirect, consequential, incidental, or punitive damages, including lost profits or data.</p>

      <p><strong>10.2 Optional Assistance.</strong> Support may be available through community forums or email at DOSAYGO's discretion.</p>

      <h2>11. Indemnification</h2>
      <p>Licensee agrees to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless DOSAYGO and its affiliates from any claims, damages, or expenses (including attorneys' fees) arising from Licensee's misuse of BrowserBox or breach of this Agreement.</p>

      <h2>12. Miscellaneous</h2>
      <p><strong>12.1 Entire Agreement.</strong> This Agreement constitutes the entire understanding between DOSAYGO and Licensee and supersedes all prior agreements.</p>
      <p><strong>12.2 Amendments.</strong> DOSAYGO may modify this Agreement at any time. Continued use of BrowserBox after such changes constitutes acceptance of the revised terms.</p>
      <p><strong>12.3 Assignment.</strong> Licensee may not assign this Agreement without DOSAYGO's prior written consent. DOSAYGO may assign this Agreement freely.</p>
      <p><strong>12.4 Severability.</strong> If any provision of this Agreement is found invalid, it will be reformed to the extent necessary, and the remaining provisions will remain in effect.</p>
